<h1>Mirlyn FAQ</h1>
  <p>Frequently Asked Questions about the Mirlyn catalog</p>
  <h2>Why the new catalog?</h2>
  <p>In August 2009 the Library launched a new catalog interface that provides users a different way to search and explore the contents of our library collections. This new interface searches the same data that is searched through Mirlyn Classic, but is designed to work more like popular Internet websites and search engines. It provides a cleaner interface to better fit user expectations and incorporates modern web features such as tagging. We welcome your comments about this system.</p>
    <p>Mirlyn is based on VuFind, an open source software project originally developed at Villanova University, with local customizations designed for the University of Michigan. </p>
    <p>Mirlyn is the primary catalog for the University of Michigan University Library, the Bentley Historical Library, the William S. Clements Library, the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (Ann Arbor), and the University of Michigan-Flint Thompson Library.</p>
    
  <h2>Is Mirlyn Classic being replaced?</h2>
  <p>No, we have no plans or timeline to eliminate our previous catalog, now called Mirlyn Classic. Mirlyn and Mirlyn Classic each have different strengths as catalog interfaces to our collections. The systems will exist side by side, allowing searchers to choose their preferred interface, for the foreseeable future. </p>

  <h2>What is the difference between Mirlyn and Mirlyn Classic?</h2>
  <p>The new Mirlyn provides an different approach to searching. It is designed to function similarly to the way popular Internet websites and search engines do. The Mirlyn catalog allows you to search the entire library collection from a single search box, retrieving many potentially relevant titles, and then to quickly narrow down the results by choosing facets or “narrowing options” presented on the left side of the screen. The set of available facets changes with each selection, always showing you the most commonly occurring terms in the current search results. This provides you with the opportunity to quickly browse the results and focus the result set based on the terms that are most relevant to your needs. This interface also provides a number of other new features.</p>
    <p>Mirlyn Classic remains available to you but is no longer the primary catalog for the University of Michigan University Library,. Mirlyn Classic will continue to provide traditional searching and includes a variety of options to build very specific and/or complex searches in order to limit retrieval to a small number of items or a single item. </p>

  <h2>What is faceted searching?</h2>
  <p>A faceted search allows you to quickly refine a search set based on a variety of criteria, such as subject, format or location. Facets (called “Narrowing Options” in Mirlyn) are generated dynamically, based on the most frequently occurring terms in the search results. Unlike a traditional library catalog, initial searches are made as broadly as possible. Facets display relationships between items, letting you discover useful results in an intuitive way. This functionality allows you to quickly narrow a potentially large result set by selecting the criteria you choose until the precise result is generated. </p>

  <h2>Why do I get such a long list of results?</h2>
  <p>Mirlyn is designed to facilitate discovery of the contents of the library collections by providing access to the widest-possible set of potentially relevant materials. The system looks for the words you entered in the search box in a variety of ways (as an exact phrase, by looking for items in which all the words you entered are present, by looking for individual words in your query, etc.) and then presents a set of results that is ranked by relevance. The items which are most likely to be relevant appear at the top of the list. The system also uses a feature called “stemming” which allows retrieval of multiple forms of a search term (for example, the term ‘bicycle' would retrieve ‘bicycle', ‘bicycles', ‘bicycling', etc.). This inclusive approach to searching, coupled with availability of dynamic facets or narrowing options, makes it easier to browse the collections in order to discover relevant materials.</p>
    <p>When searching for a small set of known items or a single item, the large number of results may appear overwhelming at first, but in most cases there will be no need to look past the first few titles on the list to find the relevant materials. When needed, clicking an appropriate facet will quickly narrow the search and reduce the size of the results set. Alternatively, using the Advanced Search screen provides a variety of options for limiting a search in advance with specific words, locations or languages. In many cases, this can significantly reduce the length of the results list.</p>

  <h2>Why haven't you provided all of the search options that are available in Mirlyn Classic?</h2>
  <p>The new Mirlyn is intended to provide a different approach to searching. In many cases, when a simple search, with relevance-ranked results, is combined with the use of facets, it provides quick access to desired materials without requiring the use of the complex specialized search options that a comparable search might require in Mirlyn Classic. </p>
    <p>Please keep in mind that there are no plans to eliminate Mirlyn Classic &emdash; it will remain available for those who prefer that style of searching. </p>

  <ul>
