<h2>Search Tips</h2>


<h3>Phrase Searching</h3>
<p>Use quotes to search an exact phrase: e.g. "occult fiction"</p>


<h3>Boolean Searching</h3> 

<p>Use AND, OR, and NOT between words to combine them with Boolean logic: e.g. <i>(heart OR cardiac) AND surgery NOT procedures</i> will find items about heart surgery or cardiac surgery but not about surgery procedures. Boolean terms must be in uppercase </p>

<h3>Plus (+) and Minus (-) Operators</h3>

Use '+' (plus) immediately before a word to make that word required --  items must contain that word in order to  match your search. Use '-' (minus) immediately before a word to exclude that word  -- items must not contain that word in order to match your search. <i>+cat -dog</i> would match all items that contain the word cat but not the word dog.
