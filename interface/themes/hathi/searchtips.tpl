<h3>Search Tips</h3>


<h4>Phrase Searching</h4>
<p>Use quotes to search an exact phrase: e.g. "occult fiction"</p>

<h4>Wildcards</h4> 

<p>Use * or ? to search for alternate forms of a
word. Use * to stand for several characters, and ? for a single
character: e.g. optim* will find optimal, optimize or optimum; wom?n
will find woman and women. </p>

<h4>Boolean Searching</h4> 

<p>Use AND and OR between words to combine
them with Boolean logic: e.g. (heart OR cardiac) AND surgery will find
items about heart surgery or cardiac surgery. Boolean terms must be in
uppercase. </p>
