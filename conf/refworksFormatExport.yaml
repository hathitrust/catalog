# Format is
#
# - Tag
#   - [taginds, "subfields", joiner]
#   - [tag, offset, length] # for control fields
#
# e.g.
# - AV
#   - [77312, atw, <joiner>]
# 
# All three tag codes and both indicator codes are required. <joiner>, used to paste together
# the fields, defaults to the null string and is optional
#
# NOTES ON THE OUTPUT
#  * identical tags are deleted. So, for example, if you get a PY (pubyear)
#    from two different places, if they agree you'll only get one PY tag
#  * Any leading and trailing spaces are deleted
#  * Any trailing characters in [;:,/] are deleted
#  * A trailing period is deleted if preceded by a number (to allow better matching)
#
# RULES FOR CONTROL TAGS IN THE FIELDMAPS
#  * A control tag is identified by having only three characters in the tag
#  * Offset is 1-based, not 0-based
#  * No checks are done on offset and length
#
#
# RULES FOR DATA TAGS IN THE FIELDMAPS
#
# To make things a little easier, you can use the following subsitutions
#  * A '.' in a tag or indicator matches anything (so, 5..2x will match any 5XX tag with 2 in indicator 1)
#  * In an indicator, '.' means "any charcter"; '~' means "space"
#  * A subfield list is either a set of letters or '~', meaning "all subfields"
#  * For subfields that repeat, all will be included unless you capitalize the letter.
#    So a subfield string of 'Ab' will give the first A plus all the b's
#  * Obviously, then, a subfield string of just 'B' will give nothing but the first subfield b
#  * The joiner defaults to the empty string. 
#  * The joiner string 'SPACE' (captialization required) means join on a single space
#  * A spec that has a single word in it is filled in interally by code. As of now, these are:
#    * TYPE (the type of reference)
#    * ID (the bibnum)
#    * RECORDURL (a full URL linking to this record in the OPAC)
